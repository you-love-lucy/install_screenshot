Five rules of Pseudocode
1) Use "start" and "stop" at the beginning and end of program.
2) Indent program statements, and keep them on one line if possible-- if not, indent
  the following lines.
3) Begin statements with lowercase letters.
4) Do not use punctuation at the end of a statement.
5) Each statement should perform one action.
